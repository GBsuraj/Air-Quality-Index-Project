# Air-Quality-Index-Project
## Problem Statement
The air quality measurements for Delhi in January 2023, the current state of air quality is concerning, especially considering the dominance of CO and particulate matter concentrations, which pose significant health risks. The irregular patterns in hourly AQI levels add complexity to addressing these issues. We need to further analyze these patterns to develop targeted mitigation strategies and protective measures for public health. The correlations between pollutants require deeper exploration to identify common sources and propose appropriate interventions.
## Key Insights
- **Pollutant Distribution:** Concentrations of various pollutants in Delhi were compiled and depicted through a pie chart, signifying the proportional concentrations. Notably, Carbon Monoxide (CO) accounts for a considerable majority, at 78.8%, of total pollutant concentrations. This is followed by PM10 at 8.69% and PM2.5 at 7.4%, both of which are particulate matters known for their adverse health effects. Other pollutants like Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitric Oxide (NO), Ozone (O3), and Ammonia (NH3) have lesser concentrations when compared with CO, PM10, and PM2.5.

- **Correlation Among Pollutants:** There is an observed correlation among the pollutants. Correlation is an important statistical measure that signifies how strongly two variables are related. Understanding the correlation can help identify common emission sources and offer insights into how the presence of one pollutant may affect or predict levels of others.

- **Hourly AQI Trends:** The data indicates hourly trends in the Air Quality Index (AQI) across different hours of the day based on mean calculations, which aids in identifying when pollution levels are at their peak over a 24-hour period. These patterns could inform residents and policymakers about the most effective times for issuing health advisories or for implementing pollution control measures.

- **AQI Category Distribution Over Time:** The distribution of air quality by AQI category indicates instances of 'Very Unhealthy', 'Hazardous', and 'Unhealthy' air quality conditions over the course of January 2023. Understanding and presenting the prevalence and distribution of these conditions over time is a vital step in public health awareness and in formulating mitigation strategies.
## Conclusion
Delhi's air quality during January 2023 was marked by particularly high levels of carbon monoxide and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), with periods of the day yielding 'Very Unhealthy' and 'Hazardous' AQI levels. The significant concentration of CO is particularly alarming and merits urgent attention. The study also provides evidence of meaningful relationships among different pollutants, indicating potential shared sources or atmospheric conditions that exacerbate pollution levels. Hourly analysis of AQI provides a granular view of daily trends, suggesting targeted timeframes for protective measures. To improve air quality and protect public health, it is crucial for policymakers to use these insights to implement effective air pollution control strategies and for citizens to be aware of peak pollution hours to minimize exposure.
